To put some order in the Chaos after the launch of OpenGov, derek of Metaspan has made a dashboard for checking votes and delegations of the 1kv validators. This is very useful since otherwise validators need to check their votes using cumbersome extrinsics or check one-by-one on Subsquare / Polkassembly.

The dashboard is accessible [here](https://metaspan.io/kusama/candidate) after you select a validator and go to the Referenda tab.

We propose a tip of 8 KSM (about 200 USD at the time of submission) for the current version of this dashboard.
